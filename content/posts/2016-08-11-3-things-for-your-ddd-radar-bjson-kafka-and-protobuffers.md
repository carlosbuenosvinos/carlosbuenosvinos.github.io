**tl;dr: Take a look to: BJSON support on Databases for persisting transactionally and searching for Value Objects and Domain Events easier. Kafka as a broker for not needing an artificial commit log in your BC. Last, Protobuffers for improving, not just performance and bandwidth, but your Domain Events versioning.**

DDD is not about technology. However, a nice piece of technology can make our life easier. I would like to point you to three technologies that I think will simplify your implementations. These _new_ things to add to your radar are: BSJON, Kafka and Protobuffers. Let&#8217;s get into more detail about why they are interesting.
