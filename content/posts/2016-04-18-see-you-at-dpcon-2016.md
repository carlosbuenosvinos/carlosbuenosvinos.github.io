I would like to let you know that I&#8217;ll be presenting on the <a href="http://www.phpconference.nl/" target="_blank">DPC</a> 2016. This year, the Dutch PHP conference celebrates its 10th anniversary. It will be held on June 23rd-25th. I&#8217;m more than happy to be there and talkÂ about &#8220;Integrating Bounded Contexts&#8221;.
