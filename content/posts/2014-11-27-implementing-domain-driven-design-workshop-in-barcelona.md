Since 2012 and after two years reading and working with Domain-Driven Design approaches, in 2014, Christian (<a href="https://twitter.com/theUniC" target="_blank">@theUniC</a>) and me went to Berlin to get trained by Vaughn Vernon, author of &#8220;Implementing Domain-Driven Design&#8221; book. The training was fantastic, all the concepts that were going around on their minds up to that moment, got stuck into the ground in the 3 days IDDD workshop. However, they were the only two PHP developers there in a room full of Java and .NET. That was quite funny.
