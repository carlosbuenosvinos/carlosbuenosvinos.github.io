On January, 31st, I was in the <a href="http://day.phpconference.es/" target="_blank">Barcelona PHP Day</a>. Albert Casademont (<a href="https://twitter.com/acasademont" target="_blank">@acasademont</a>) was giving his <a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/13530" target="_blank">talk</a> about PHP 7. He talked about features, benchmarks and internals. He said that he was subscribed to the PHP Internals mailing list and I thought that more developers should too. However, it&#8217;s not so easy to get there.
