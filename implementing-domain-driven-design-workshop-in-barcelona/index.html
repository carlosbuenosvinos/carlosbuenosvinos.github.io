The training was fantastic, all the concepts that were going around on their minds up to that moment, got stuck into the ground in the 3 days IDDD workshop.

<p>Now, Vaughn Vernon (<a href="https://twitter.com/VaughnVernon" target="_blank">@VaughnVernon</a>) is giving its talk in Barcelona on March 2-4, 2015. Early tickets are available in <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/idddworkshop-barcelona-registration-13970591415" target="_blank">Evenbrite</a>, the price is nice 1000€ using SUPER_IDDD promotional code, valid until November 30th. I strongly recommend this workshop. See you there.</p><ul class="pa0">
