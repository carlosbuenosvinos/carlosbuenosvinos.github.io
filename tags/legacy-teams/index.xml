      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  After talking about &lt;a title=&#34;Legacy Code and Teams Series: Training Sessions and Technical Committee&#34; href=&#34;http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/legacy-code-and-teams-series-training-sessions-and-technical-committee/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Technical Committee and Training Sessions&lt;/a&gt; in the previous post of the series, today, I&amp;#8217;ll carry on with adding Composer to legacy projects without pain.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  The day I left Emagister, I was sat down with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/eberhm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/theUniC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Christian&lt;/a&gt; having beers and talking about all the cool things we did there. We were reviewing each of the changes, it cost, benefits, feelings in the team, etc. When I said, &amp;#8220;what about composer? that was cool!&amp;#8221;, Eber said, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Composer is not just cool, it&amp;#8217;s a must.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;. As always, he was too right. It has been also the first thing done at Atrápalo.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  Starting with a brand-new project using &lt;a href=&#34;https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#create-project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;create-project command&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;#8217;s easy, but, what about those developers dealing with a big legacy project, with custom autoloader, PEAR dependencies, hardcoded fixes in a external library, non PSR-0 code, etc. Don&amp;#8217;t worry, you can also take benefit of Composer. However, there are some tricks you should take care of in order to face those issues.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Next: &lt;a title=&#34;Legacy Code and Teams Series: Composer&#34; href=&#34;http://carlosbuenosvinos.com/legacy-code-and-teams-series-composer/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Legacy Code and Teams Series: Composer&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When talking with some friends about how we are improving Atrápalo legacy code and development process, they asked for creating a presentation and give a talk about the steps we are following, hows, whys, and so on. It sound to me interesting so I would like to help sharing my experiences, not just the Atrápalo ones because when working at Emagister we did something quite similar with Christian, Eber, Dario, Lluís, Jordi, Jose Luís and the rest of the team with great results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into a talk, I would like to start a serie of posts about my way dealing with legacy projects. I&amp;#8217;m really interested in listening from you and your comments in order to enrich the final result. So, any suggestion or experience is really welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
