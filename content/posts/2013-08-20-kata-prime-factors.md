## Context

Although quite short, this kata is fascinating in the way it shows how &#8220;if&#8221; statements become &#8220;while&#8221; statements as the number of test cases increase.  It’s also a wonderful example of how algorithms sometimes become simpler as they become more general.

## Level

Easy / 40 minutes

## Requirements

<div>
  Write a class named “PrimeFactors” that has one method: &#8220;generate&#8221;. The &#8220;generate&#8221; method takes an integer argument and returns an array of integers.  That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.
