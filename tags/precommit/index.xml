      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, in the PHP Barcelona Monthly Talk, I was talking with some mates about the GitHub migration we have recently done at Atrápalo. They were interested in branches, deployments, code reviews and so on. However, they were specially surprised about who we are dealing with pre-commit hooks at Atrápalo. Let&amp;#8217;s see if there&amp;#8217;s more people out there interested in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
