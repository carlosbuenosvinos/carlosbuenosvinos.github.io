This week, Vaughn Vernon, DDD guru and author of multiple books including [_Implementing Domain-Driven Design_](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0321834577), [_Reactive Messaging Pattern with the Actor Model_](https://www.amazon.com/Reactive-Messaging-Patterns-Actor-Model/dp/0133846830/) and [_Domain-Driven Design Distilled_](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0134434420)_,_ announced via Twitter that _Domain-Driven Design Distilled_ Spanish translation would be available soon.

A couple of days later, we discovered that Yuji Kiriki, Colombian Software Engineer, will be the official reviewer. He is about to start soon the revision. That’s great news!

The official translator remained unknown… until now! **I’m happy to announce that I’m honored to be the person responsible for such a challenge.** I have been working for the last months in order to translate this great book. I just want to thank Vaughn for trusting me. Being able to review in detail every idea, every word, every intent was a great learning experience. I’ll keep you posted about the final dates.
