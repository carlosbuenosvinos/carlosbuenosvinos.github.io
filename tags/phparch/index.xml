Here’s the introduction:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“With the rise of DDD (domain-driven development), architectures promoting domain-centric designs are becoming more popular. This is the case with &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hexagonal Architecture&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, also known as &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ports and Adapters&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that seems to have been rediscovered recently by PHP developers. Invented in 2005 by Alistair Cockburn, one of the Agile Manifesto authors, the Hexagonal Architecture allows an application to be equally driven by users, programs, automated tests, or batch scripts, while being developed and tested in isolation from its eventual run-time devices and databases. This results in infrastructure-agnostic web applications that are easier to test, write, and maintain. Let’s see how to apply it using real PHP examples.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like to share with you some thought, the cover and the code repository.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
