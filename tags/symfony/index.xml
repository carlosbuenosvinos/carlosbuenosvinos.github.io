Capifony is a ruby gem based in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Capistrano&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> v2, an open source tool for running scripts on multiple servers with a deployment flow built-in. It’s primary use is for easily deploying applications. While it was built specifically for deploying &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rails&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> apps, it’s pretty simple to customize it to deploy other types of applications. At that time, alternatives were shell scripting or Fabric. Now there’s a better one, Ansistrano.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating progressively to Symfony without pain with StackPHP</title><link>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/migrating-progressively-to-symfony-without-pain-with-stackphp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2015 03:00:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/migrating-progressively-to-symfony-without-pain-with-stackphp/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the previous post, I talked about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->how to migrated to Symfony without pain using Apache Dumper&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The idea was to generate Symfony routes in an Apache configuration file or .htaccess so it can be included in your virtual host. By including a fallback route to your current framework entry point, you can create new routes in Symfony without touching your previous framework. You can develop normally your new Symfony app, just defining new routes or the same old ones and regenerating the routes file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This approach has some small pitfalls. Each time a new Symfony route is created, the Apache configuration file with the routes must be regenerated. If you’re creating many routes, this can be annoying. As explained in the previous post, there is another option that fixes this issue and have more features, &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stack&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Now, it’s like in &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atrápalo&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, let’s see how it’s working.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrating progressively to Symfony without pain</title><link>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/migrating-progressively-to-symfony-without-pain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Mar 2015 09:47:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/migrating-progressively-to-symfony-without-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Atrápalo&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a travel e-commerce website founded in 2000. Based in Barcelona, Spain, it sells flights, trips, tickets, booking restaurants, car renting, etc. to 10 different countries. It’s a 9000 world Alexa ranking and it’s running PHP. Since 2014, we are pushing hard in order to evolve technically using best practices, agile methodologies and distributed architectures. One of the key aspects is the framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are currently migrating to Symfony in order to speed up the development process and reduce the maintenance costs. We are doing it progressively, step by step, without rewriting the whole application, no green-field project, without any dedicated team neither. All developers are involved in this process, and by policy, each new feature is developed using Symfony while the old features remain served by the old framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would say this process is going quite smoothly, without pain. Based on some emails and tweets I have received, here are some tricks about how we are doing it. Hope it helps!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remove non used PHP files in your project</title><link>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/remove-non-used-php-files-in-your-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:40:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/remove-non-used-php-files-in-your-project/</guid><description>&lt;p>When a project gets bigger, specially when using a framework, it’s mandatory to have some processes that help you in removing code that is not used anymore such as models, classes, template files, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is not an easy task, however the benefits or removing non used coded are tons (code coverage, development speed, bugs, etc.). But what’s the best approach to detect that a template file is not used anymore in your PHP project?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
