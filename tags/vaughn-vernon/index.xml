      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since 2012 and after two years reading and working with Domain-Driven Design approaches, in 2014, Christian (&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/theUniC&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@theUniC&lt;/a&gt;) and me went to Berlin to get trained by Vaughn Vernon, author of &amp;#8220;Implementing Domain-Driven Design&amp;#8221; book. The training was fantastic, all the concepts that were going around on their minds up to that moment, got stuck into the ground in the 3 days IDDD workshop. However, they were the only two PHP developers there in a room full of Java and .NET. That was quite funny.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
