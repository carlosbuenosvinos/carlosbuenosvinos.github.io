A game is IMHO the most difficult piece of software to write. Think for a second. It needs support for user input devices (mouse, keywords, gamepads, etc.), graphics (2D or 3D), sounds and music, physics, AI, networking when playing with more players and it has to perform really, really fast. That’s not the typical PHP web, is it? Today, I would like to present my first really small and silly game, and probably the last one :) for iOS/Android and the technologies behind it. Hope you like it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Javascript Apps, APIs, AJAX and CORS</title><link>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/javascript-apps-apis-ajax-and-cors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2015 08:30:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/javascript-apps-apis-ajax-and-cors/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you are developing Javascript applications that make AJAX calls directly to an API that you don’t control, you will probably experiment issues with CORS. If you take a look to your console, the following message will appear:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://foo/bar. No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header is present on the requested resource. Origin ‘http://localhost:8100’ is therefore not allowed access.&lt;/p>
