<p><a href="http://dot.carlosbuenosvinos.com" target="_blank"><strong>&#8220;Dot: Puzzles for smart masses&#8221;</strong></a> is a Web-based technologies game, developed using Javascript and embedded into iOS and Android using Apache Cordova.</p>

<h3 id="technologies-used">Technologies used</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s review all the projects and technologies used.</p>

<h3 id="impactjs">ImpactJS</h3>

<p><a href="http://impactjs.com/" target="_blank">Impact</a> is a JavaScript Game Engine that allows you to develop stunning HTML5 Games for desktop and mobile browsers. It&#8217;s not super really well maintained, but it&#8217;s really powerful. There are other interesting options such as <a href="http://phaser.io" target="_blank">Phaser.io</a>.</p>

<h3 id="apache-cordova">Apache Cordova</h3>

<p><a href="https://cordova.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Cordova</a> is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript. Combined with a UI framework such as jQuery Mobile or Dojo Mobile or Sencha Touch, this allows a smartphone app to be developed with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<h3 id="ionic-framework">Ionic framework</h3>

<p><a href="http://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> is the beautiful, open source front-end SDK for developing hybrid mobile apps with web technologies. As a killer feature, &#8220;ionic resources&#8221; that generates icons and splash screens for all devices and device sizes with a single command.</p>

<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m generating the levels automatically using the <a href="http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html" target="_blank">Symfony Console Component</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking" target="_blank">backtracking algorithm</a>. In such algorithms, using <a href="https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php/read" target="_blank">Value Objects</a> is especially interesting for keeping immutable complex data structures such as trees.</p>

<p>Hope you like it.</p><ul class="pa0">
