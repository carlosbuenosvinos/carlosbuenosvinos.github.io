[**ansistrano.deploy**](https://github.com/ansistrano/deploy) and [**ansistrano.rollback**](https://github.com/ansistrano/rollback) are Ansible Galaxy roles to easily manage the deployment process for scripting applications such as PHP, Python, and Ruby. It’s an Ansible port for Capistrano.

First commit was on August 14th, 2014. Almost 5 years later, and only 492 commits after, Ansistrano has become a really useful tool for those who are not using containers yet.

> Today is a great day and we want to celebrate it with all of you

We started tracking anonymously all the deployments done using Ansistrano in October 2015. One count for every deployment regardless of how many servers you have. Actually, more than 1500 deployments are performed every day using Ansistrano (apart from the ones not tracked due to disabling the feature). It looks that Thursdays are the most preferred day for deploying.

On behalf of [Ricard Clau](https://twitter.com/ricardclau), [Christian Soronellas](https://twitter.com/theUniC) and myself, we want to share our joy for having reached +1700 stars on [GitHub](https://medium.com/u/8df3bf3c40ae), being the most stared Ansible Galaxy role, +70 contributors, and **having reached more than 1 Million deployments**.
