You are more than welcome!&lt;/strong> The main concerns are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How do I fetch an Entity from ElasticSearch, using new and without firing the Event?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do I create stubs on the Entity that is firing the Domain Event?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are pros and cons of firing the Domain Event in the __constructor or in the named constructor?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So, I’ll take the original code as a starting point, and I’ll suggest different strategies to answer those questions. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>“new” and fluent interfaces</title><link>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/new-and-fluent-interfaces/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Nov 2013 14:39:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://carlosbuenosvinos.com/new-and-fluent-interfaces/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, I was with some friends and we were talking about fluent interfaces and I show them something that they didn’t know. I got surprised about it because it was introduced in PHP 5.4.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
